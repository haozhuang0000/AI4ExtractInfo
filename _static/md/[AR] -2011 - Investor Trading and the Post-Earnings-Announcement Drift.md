ABSTRACT: We examine whether the two distinct post-earnings-announcement drifts associated with seasonal random-walk-based and analyst-based earnings surprises are attributable to the trading activities of distinct sets of investors. We predict and find that small (large) traders continue to trade in the direction of seasonal random-walkbased (analyst-based) earnings surprises after earnings announcements. We also find that when small (large) traders react more thoroughly to seasonal random-walk(analyst-) based earnings surprises at the earnings announcements, the respective drift attenuates. Further evidence suggests that delayed small trades associated with random-walk-based surprises are consistent with small traders' failure to understand time-series properties of earnings, whereas delayed large trades associated with analyst-based surprises are more consistent with a longer price discovery process. We also find that the analyst-based drift has declined in recent years.

# 1. INTRODUCTION  

ore than four decades of research on post-earnings-announcement drift consistently finds that stock prices tend to move in the direction of earnings surprises following . earnings announcements. While the majority of prior studies focus on the drift associated with seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises, recent studies document a drift associated with analyst-based earnings surprises that appears not only distinct from, but also even larger than the drift associated with seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises (Livnat and Mendenhall 2006; Doyle et al. 2006). Despite the extensive literature on post-earnings-announcement drift, there is no consensus to date regarding the source(s) of either drift.  

Our study examines whether the distinct drifts are attributable, at least in part, to different identifiable subsets of investors who under-react to different forms of earnings innovations. Evidence on this issue is important for researchers and practitioners to understand the nature and the source of distinct drifts associated with seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises and analyst-based earnings surprises. Indeed, Livnat and Mendenhall (2006, 180) argue that “[i]f researchers do not understand how the magnitude of the drift depends on the specification of earnings surprise, they stand little chance of understanding the nature of the anomaly."  

We hypothesize that the two post-earnings-announcement drifts are attributable, at least in part, to distinct sets of investors (small and large traders) who use different earnings expectations models, but fail to fully react to earnings news. Specifically, if small traders use seasonal randomwalk-based earnings expectations models but under-react to the seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises, then we expect that post-announcement trading by small traders helps to explain the drift associated with seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises (hereafter, RW drift). Similarly, if large traders base their earnings expectations on analyst forecasts but do not fully react to the analyst-based earnings surprises, then we anticipate that post-announcement trading by large traders helps to explain the drift associated with analyst-based earnings surprises (hereafter, AF drift).  

Despite the intuitive appeal of our expectations, there is little evidence that links either drift to specific investors’ trading. For example, although Battalio and Mendenhall (2005) and Bhattacharya (2001) find that small traders are more likely to trade on the RW earnings surprise around earnings announcements and large traders trade on the AF earnings surprise around earnings announcements, they do not link the RW or AF drift to trades by specific investor groups in the post-announcement period. Bartov et al. (200o) find that the RW drift decreases with the level of institutional ownership and conclude that institutional investors improve the efficiency with which RW earnings surprises are priced. However, they do not investigate the AF drift or link investor trades to the RW drift. More recently, Hirshleifer et al. (2008) investigate whether the RW drift is attributable to individual investors trading contrary to the RW earnings surprises at earnings announcements, which creates underpricing after good news and overpricing after bad news. Contrarian trading by individual investors is an alternative sufficient, but not necessary condition for the RW drift. Hirshleifer et al. (2008) find no evidence that individual investors trade contrary to RW earnings surprises, and offer three alternative explanations for the RW drift: the RW drift is an artifact of poor measurement of risk-adjusted returns; individual investors cause the RW drift but their proprietary sample from a single discount brokerage fails to detect this relation; or institutional investors cause the RW drift. In sum, the effect of distinct investor groups on the RW drift is far from settled and there is little explanation as to whom or what causes the AF drift. To build on prior research, we investigate the possibility that the RW and AF drifts could be explained by distinct groups of traders who under-react to differing earnings news. Using trade and quote data for trades executed from 1993 through 2005, we classify investors as small or large traders based on trade size, and use a buy-sell order imbalance metric to estimate large and small traders’ net buying activities. We then examine small and large trades around and after earnings announcements and their relation to the post-earnings-announcement drifts.2  

Results are consistent with our predictions. We find that only small traders systematically trade in the direction of the RW earnings surprises after earnings announcements. Likewise, we find that only large traders trade in the direction of the AF earnings surprises after earnings announcements. This evidence is consistent with distinct sets of traders explaining, at least in part, the two post-earnings-announcement drifts. Specifically, it suggests that small traders create upward (downward) price pressure on stocks in the post-announcement period for firms with good (bad) RW news. Likewise, it suggests that large traders create upward (downward) price pressure on stocks in the post-announcement period for firms with good (bad) AF news.  

If the RW and AF drifts are manifested as an under-reaction to earnings news by small and large traders, respectively, then the more these traders act on the earnings news during the announcement period, the lower the subsequent drift should be. Consistent with this expectation, we find that when small traders trade more intensely in the direction of the RW earnings surprises during the announcement period, the magnitude of the subsequent RW drift is lower. Likewise, when large traders trade more intensely in the direction of the AF earnings surprises during the announcement period, the magnitude of the AF drift is lower.  

Because large traders are considered relatively more sophisticated than are small traders (e.g., as evidenced by their more sophisticated earnings expectation model), the nature of the underreaction by small and large traders and the related drifts is likely qualitatively different. We conduct several analyses to further explore and contrast the RW and AF drifts. First, we expect that the timing of post-announcement trades is a function of investors’ relative sophistication. If large traders are relatively more sophisticated than small traders, we expect that large traders end their trading on AF earnings surprises more quickly than small traders end their trading on RW earnings surprises. Consistent with our expectation, we find that large traders trade more at the early stage of the post-announcement period, whereas small traders spread their trades throughout the 60-day post-announcement period.  

Second, we examine small and large trades around one- to four-quarter-ahead earnings announcements using the methodology employed by Bernard and Thomas (1990). Consistent with small traders being less sophisticated, we find that small trades around subsequent earnings announcements are predictable based on lagged one- to four-quarter RW earnings surprises. Consistent with large traders being relatively more sophisticated and their under-reaction being shortlived, we find no evidence of large trades at earnings announcements being associated with prior AF earnings surprises. This evidence suggests that the RW drift, but not AF drift, is largely explained by small or unsophisticated traders’ failure to recognize the time-series property of earnings.  

Third, we investigate whether the AF drift and post-announcement trades by large traders associated with the AF earnings surprise are more pronounced when the AF earnings surprise is more difficult to interpret. Prior research finds that the AF drift is greater when analysts’ forecasts are more heterogeneous (Liang 2003), suggesting that investors have difficulty interpreting AF earnings surprises when analysts’ forecasts are less correlated. Consistent with large traders requiring more post-earnings-announcement information to interpret earnings surprises when analysts’ forecasts are more heterogeneous, we find that the AF drift and post-announcement trades by large traders associated with the AF earnings surprise are more pronounced when there is more heterogeneity among analysts’ forecasts. This finding suggests that large traders’ under-reaction and the related AF drift may be attributable, at least in part, to a longer price discovery process when earnings are more difficult to interpret.  

Fourth, we investigate how post-earnings-announcement analyst forecast revisions affect large and small traders’ post-announcement trading on earnings surprises. If large traders’ underreaction is corrected in the post-announcement period through subsequent price discovery, analyst forecast revisions may be one source of such information discovery (Gleason and Lee 2003).′ We find that analyst forecast revisions are sluggish with respect to prior earnings information and that much of the post-announcement trading by large traders based on the AF earnings surprise is attributable to information in analyst forecast revisions that continue to be correlated with the AF earnings surprise well after the earnings announcement. This evidence further suggests a longer price discovery explanation for the AF drift with analyst forecast revisions serving as one source of information discovery.  

Finally, we examine the magnitude of the RW and AF drifts and related post-announcement trading by small and large traders in more recent years. Results suggest that the magnitude of the AF drift decreases in more recent years (after 1999), while the RW drift does not change. This evidence is consistent with a more efficient price discovery process for information contained in the AF earnings surprise in more recent years as the AF drift may have received more attention. Given the relatively new discovery of and the little attention that the AF drift received during the earlier years in our sample, sophisticated investors may have not sufficiently exploited the AF drift during this period, which may explain the larger AF drift in earlier years.  

This study makes the following contributions. First, we predict and find that small traders systematically trade in the direction of the RW earnings surprise after earnings announcements, whereas large traders? trading during the post-earnings-announcement period is in the direction of the AF earnings surprise. This evidence suggests that the RW and AF drifts are attributable, at least in part, to distinct sets of investors who use different earnings expectation models. Second, to our knowledge, this is the first study to link announcement period trading by distinct groups of investorstothe $R W$ and $A F$ drifts. These findings are important in understanding the respective drifts and the investors who influence the size and type of the drifts. Third, we provide evidence that the two drifts are qualitatively different. The RW drift is largely explained by small traders? failure to understand the time-series property of earnings and therefore represents investor naivete. In contrast, the AF drift may be explained by a longer price discovery process by large traders that highly correlates with subsequent analyst forecast revisions and increases with analysts’ forecast heterogeneity. Finally, we find that the AF drift and related large trades during the postannouncement period have decreased in more recent years as the AF drift may have received more attention. In sum, we conclude that the two drifts are quite different despite both being manifested as an investor under-reaction to earnings news.  

Section II develops hypotheses. Section IMI describes how we classify trades into buys and sells and how we partition small and large traders. Section IV presents our sample selection and descriptive statistics, and Section V presents the results of our hypotheses tests. Section VI provides evidence of additional differences between the AF and RW drifts. Section VII summarizes andconcludes.  

# II. HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT Investors’ Post-Announcement Trading  

To date, there is no consensus regarding who or what causes either drift, random-walk-based or analyst-based. While prior studies have not investigated the source(s) of the AF drift (given its relatively new discovery), recent studies have begun to focus on how different investor groups infuence the RW drift. Bartov et al. (200o) find that the RW drift decreases with the level of institutional ownership and conclude that institutional investors improve on the earningsprocessing problems that cause the RW drift. Their finding implies that higher individual ownership exacerbates the RW drift. Similarly, Ke and Ramalingegowda (2005) find that quarterly changes in transient institutional ownership in the direction of RW earnings surprise (e.g., an increase in ownership after good news) are associated with lower RW drift. This evidence suggests that more aggressive trading by transient institutional investors at earnings announcements negates mispricing associated with RW earnings surprises.  

More recently, Hirshleifer et al. (2008) use individual trading data to investigate whether naive individual investors trade contrary to the RW earnings surprises at earnings announcements, which creates underpricing after good RW news and overpricing after bad RW news. Implicit in the “contrarian trading” hypothesis is the presence of a group of informed or more sophisticated traders who attempt to move prices based on the RW earnings surprises and a second group of naive individual investors who trade contrary to the RW earnings surprises. Hirshleifer et al. (2008) use a proprietary sample of individual trades from a single discount brokerage firm and find no evidence that individual investors trade contrary to RW earnings surprises.  

To build on prior research, we investigate an alternative explanation for the RW drift (and AF drift). We hypothesize that the two distinct post-earnings-announcement drifts are attributable, at least in part, to distinct sets of investors (small and large traders) who use different earnings expectation models but fail to fully react to earnings news. Our expectations differ from Hirshleifer et al. (2008) in that our reasoning is based on two different investor groups (small and large traders) trading on two different earnings signals (RW and AF earnings surprises) with both investor groups under-reacting to their respective earnings signals, as opposed to two different investor groups trading on one signal (RW earnings surprises) with one naive group trading contrary to the signal.  

We base our hypothesis on four streams of prior research: (1) findings that during the earnings-announcement period, small traders react to RW earnings surprises, while large traders tend to react to more accurate AF earnings surprises,? (2) asset-pricing models that suggest that equilibrium prices aggregate different information sets of all investors, (3) behavioral evidence that investors tend to under-react to news, and (4) evidence that arbitrage activities are often limited. Collectively, these factors create a sufficient condition to generate two distinct drifts.  

Bhattacharya (2001) studies the trading volume of large and small traders during earningsannouncement periods and finds that small traders’ earnings expectations resemble a seasonal random-walk. Battalio and Mendenhall (2005) employ order imbalance measures and find that around earnings announcements, small traders respond to Rw earnings surprises while large traders respond to AF earnings surprises. Mikhail et al. (2007) find that, while large traders trade in the direction of analyst stock recommendations and earnings forecast revisions, small traders do not. Collectively, these findings suggest that large traders use a more sophisticated earnings expectation, consistent with large traders likely being wealthier and more informed than small traders (Easley and O'Hara 1987; Lee 1992). The implication of these findings is that different investor groups (i.e., small and large traders) systematically form different earnings expectations and trade accordingly.7  

Prior equilibrium models suggest that investors with differing beliefs can impact prices (Grossman 1976; Grossman and Stiglitz 1980; Admati 1985; Kandel and Pearson 1995; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). These models suggest that, in equilibrium, stock prices reflect the weighted average beliefs of different investor groups, with the risk-bearing capacity of each investor group determining its relative weight. These models also suggest that investor groups with differing earnings expectations (e.g., small traders who form their earnings expectation and trade based on RW earnings surprises and large traders who form their earnings expectation and trade based on AF earnings surprises) can impact prices. Consistent with this implication, Walther (1997) finds that stock returns reflect both RW earnings surprises and AF earnings surprises.  

Prior behavioral research has suggested that market participants generally underestimate the implications of current earnings for future earnings. For example, Maines and Hand (1996) and Calegari and Fargher (1997) find that both undergraduate business and M.B.A. students seem to underestimate the auto-regressive component of the seasonal changes in quarterly earnings in the process of forecasting earnings. Stevens and Williams (2004) find that undergraduate business students under-react to both positive and negative news. Likewise, Mendenhall (1991), Ali et al. (1992), Abarbanell and Bernard (1992), and Abarbanell and Bushee (1997） find that analysts underestimate the persistence of earnings surprises in revising their earnings forecasts. In addition, several studies (e.g., Bushee 2001; Ke and Petroni 2004; Bradshaw et al. 2004; Callen et al. 2005) find that institutional investors have difficulty interpreting financial information.  

Arbitrage activities can potentially reduce the magnitude of the drifts. However, prior research shows that arbitrage forces can be quite limited in financial markets (De Long et al. 1990a, 1990b; Shleifer and Vishny 1997). A maintained assumption of our analysis is that arbitrageurs do not completely eliminate under-reaction, because if arbitrage activities quickly correct initial underreaction to earnings news, these post-announcement drifts would not occur.  

Overall, the implication of these four streams of research is that the RW and AF drifts could be explained by distinct groups of investors that form their earnings expectations differently, who both impact prices and systematically under-react to earnings news. Because small traders are more likely to use RW earnings models to form their earnings expectations, we expect that trading by small traders in the post-announcement period primarily contributes to the RW drift. Likewise, because large traders are more apt to base their earnings expectations on analyst forecasts, we anticipate that their trading contributes more to the AF drift if they likewise fail to fully react to earnings surprises. We formulate the following hypotheses related to the post-earningsannouncement trading behavior of small and large traders:  

H1: Small traders are more likely to trade shares in the direction of seasonal random-walkbased earnings surprises after earnings announcements.   
H2: Large traders are more likely to trade shares in the direction of analyst-based earnings surprises after earnings announcements.  

Recent research questions whether small traders represent individuals or instead institutions that split their trades into smaller trades (Barclay and Warner 1993; Chakravarty 2001; Campbell et al. 2005), whereas other studies present evidence consistent with small traders representing individual investors (Easley and O'Hara 1987; Lee 1992; De Franco et al. 2007; Bhattacharya et al. 2007; Ayers et al. 2008). It is important to note that this study's hypotheses are not contingent on small traders being individual investors and large traders being institutions. Instead, our expectations rely solely on small traders under-reacting to the less sophisticated RW earnings surprises and large traders under-reacting to AF earnings surprises. To the extent that both small traders and large traders represent the same traders (e.g., institutions that split their trades into small trades but use analyst forecasts to create their earnings expectations), this should bias against finding evidence supporting our hypotheses that predict trading differences between small and large traders.  

# Effect of Earnings-Announcement Period Trading on Subsequent Drift  

If small and large traders′ activities help explain the RW and AF drifts, respectively, then we expect a relation between the two drifts and the respective trading intensity by small and large traders around earnings announcements. Specifically, if investors assimilate the earnings news more thoroughly and thus trade more intensely around earnings announcements on RW and AF earnings surprises, then the magnitude of the respective RW and AF drifts should be lower. Since we hypothesize that small traders contribute to the RW drift, we expect that the more they trade at the announcement period on RW earnings surprises, the lower the RW drift. Likewise, we expect that the more large traders trade at the announcement period on AF earnings surprises, the lower the AF drift:  

H3: The more intense the earnings-announcement period trading by small traders on seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises, the smaller the post-earnings-announcement drift associated with seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises.   
H4: The more intense the earnings-announcement period trading by large traders on analystbased earnings surprises, the smaller the post-earnings-announcement drift associated with analyst-based earnings surprises.  

# III.BUY-SELLORDERIMBALANCEFORSMALLANDLARGETRADERS  

We obtain stock quotes and investor trade data from the New York Stock Exchange's Trade and Quote (TAQ) database for years 1993, the year the TAQ database begins, through 2005. Using the Lee and Ready (1991) and Lee (1992) algorithm, we classify trades into buyer-initiated or seller-initiated trades. While the number of shares bought equals the number of shares sold in a transaction, the Lee (1992) algorithm identifies the likelihood that a transaction is buyer-initiated Or seller-initiated.9  

Specifically, we compare traded prices with quotes that are at least five seconds earlier. If the traded price is above the mid-point of the bid-ask spread, then we define the trade as a buy $(B U Y)$ If the traded price is below the mid-point of the bid-ask spread, then we define the trade as a sell (SELL).For day $k$ we ad u allthe buys $\Sigma_{n=1}^{M}B U Y_{i m}$ and althe sels $\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}S E L L_{i n}.$ Where $M$ isthe total number of buys on Day $k$ and $N$ is the total number of sells on Day $k$ We then compute daily buy-sell order imbalance (i.e, net-buy) $B M S_{i}$ $(\Sigma_{m=1}^{M}B U Y_{i m}-\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}S E\dot{L}L_{i n})$ . A positive (negative) $B M S_{i}$ indicates net-buying (net-selling) on Day $k$  

Because we are interested in excess trading activities, we subtract normal daily net-buy from the daily net-buy measure during the event period. We measure normal daily net-buy during the control period, a 40-day period from Day $-45$ to Day $^{-6}$ relative to the earnings announcement Day $i$ 10 Specifically, the normal daily net-buy relative to Day $i$ is the average daily net-buy computed as:  

$$
N B M S_{i}=\sum_{k\,\in\,[-45,-6]}B M S_{i,k}/T
$$  

where $T$ is the total number of days with data available for BMS. Our daily excess net-buy measure is defined as $B M S_{i}-N B M S_{i}$  

Finally, to facilitate cross-sectional comparison of our daily excess net-buy measure, we scale it by the normal daily trading volume (i.e., daily trading volume during the control period). Daily trading volume, $B P S_{i},$ is defined as daily $B U Y$ plus daily SELL (i.e, $\Sigma_{m=1}^{M}B U Y_{i m}+\Sigma_{n=1}^{N}S E L L_{i n})$ and the normal daily trading volume relative to Day $i$ is the average daily buy plus sell:  

$$
N B P S_{i}=\sum_{k\,\in\,[-45,-6]}B P S_{i,k}/T
$$  

where $T$ is the total number of days with data available for $B P S$ 11 The excess net-buy on Day $k$ during the event period (relative to the earnings announcement Day $i)$ is therefore defined as net-buy in excess of the control period net-buy, scaled by the control period volume:  

$$
E X B M S_{i,k}=\frac{B M S_{i,k}-N B M S_{i}}{N B P S_{i}}.
$$  

This measure captures the excess net-buying activities on Day $k$ . Once we have a measure of daily excess net-buy, we calculate the average excess net-buy during an event window $[k_{1},k_{2}]$ (relative to the earnings announcement Day $i$ as $\Sigma_{k=k_{1}}^{k_{2}}E X B M S_{i,k}^{\overset{\cdot}{\rfloor}}/\left(k_{2}-k_{1}+1\right)$  

To analyze the trading behavior of smali and large traders, we compute excess net-buy for small trades and large trades separately.12 Specifically, if the dollar value of a round lot trade is below $55{,}000$ , then we classify the trade as a small trade. If the dollar value of a round lot trade is above $^{\S30,000}$ , then we classify the trade as a large trade. Note that there are no exact cut-offs for defining small and large trades. The $^\mathrm{\S5,000}$ and $^{\S30,000}$ cut-offs are used here to distinguish small and large traders that prior research suggests form earnings expectations based on RW and AF earnings surprises, respectively. We use a buffer of $^\mathrm{\Phi25,000}$ between the $55{,}000$ cut-off for small trades and the $\mathbb{S}30{,}000$ cut-off for large trades to reduce the ambiguity that a trade is initiated by a small or large trader (Lee and Radhakrishna 2000).13  

# IV. SAMPLE AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  

# Sample Selection  

We obtain actual quarterly earnings, analyst forecasts of quarterly earnings, and earnings announcement dates from the I/B/E/S unadjusted file for the period 1993-2005.14 We also require frms to have I/B/E/S earnings for the same quarter in the prior year to calculate RW earnings surprise. We define Rw earnings surprise $(R W)$ as:  

$$
R W\!=(E P S_{t}-E P S_{t-4})/P_{t-1}
$$  

where $E P S_{t}$ is the I/B/E/S actual earnings per share (EPS) for quarter t, $E P S_{t-4}$ is the I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ and $P_{t-1}$ is stock price at the beginning of quarter $t$ 15,16  

Similar to Equation (4), we define AF earnings surprise $(A F)$ as the I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus the analyst forecast for quarter $t$ , deflated by beginning of quarter $t$ stock price in Compustat. We use the single-most recent forecast made by the timeliest analyst(s) prior to the earnings announcement date as our analyst forecast.7 When there is more than one analyst forecast on the most recent day, we take the mean of these forecasts. Consistent with prior studies, we convert $R W$ and $A F$ into earnings surprise deciles based on the magnitude of earnings surprises in the population in the same quarter. Similar to Livnat and Mendenhall (2006), we focus on a 60-day post-earnings-announcement period and require firms to have stock return data from the CRSP Daily  Stock  file during the period $[-1,~+65]$ surrounding earnings announcement dates. We obtain 129,215 observations based on these selection criteria. Finally, we merge this data with excess net-buy measures and require no missing excess net-buy measures for both the $[-1,+1]$ and $[+6,\,+65]$ periods following earnings announcements.1α For regression analyses, we delete observations in the top or bottom 1 percentile in the distributions of excess net-buy measures. Our final sample includes 73,469 observations for 5,661 firms.19  

# Descriptive Statistics for the Earnings Announcements Period  

Table 1 displays abnormal returns and average excess net-buy for small and large traders during the three-day $[-1,\,+1]$ earnings-announcement period, for quintiles of RW and AF earnings surprises. Panel A reports the magnitude of the average value of three-day cumulative abnormal returns for the 25 portfolios formed by the RW and AF earnings surprises quintiles. Within each AF quintile, abnormal returns generally increase in RW quintiles, and within each RW quintile, abnormal returns generally increase in AF quintiles, consistent with Walther (1997).  

Panel B of Table 1 shows the mean values of three-day average excess net-buy for small traders around the earnings-announcement period for the 25 portfolios formed by RW and AF quintiles. Within each AF quintile, small traders’ excess net-buy generally increases in RW quintiles. On the other hand, within each RW quintile, the pattern with respect to AF quintiles is less clear. Consistent with Bhattacharya (2001) and Battalio and Mendenhall (2005), our data suggest that small traders react more to RW earnings surprises during the announcement period.  

Panel C of Table 1 shows the mean value of three-day average excess net-buy for large traders around the earnings-announcement period. Within each RW quintile, large traders’ excess net-buy generally increases in AF quintiles. However, within each AF quintile, we do not observe any systematic pattern between large traders’ excess net-buy and RW quintiles. In sum, data indicate that large traders’ earnings-announcement period trading responds only to AF earnings surprises, consistent with Battlio and Mendenhall (2005).20°  

# Descriptive Statistics for the Post-Earnings-Announcement Period  

Table 2 provides statistics on the 60-day $[+6,\,+65]$ cumulative abnormal returns during the post-earnings-announcement period, and small and large trader excess net-buy for RW and AF quintiles. Panel A reports the average 60-day cumulative abnormal returns for the 25 portfolios sorted on RW and AF earnings surprises. Overall, the average abnormal returns during the postearnings-announcement period generally increase both in AF and RW earnings surprises, although the results are not monotonic within quintiles. Regarding the magnitudes of the two drifts, we find that the spread in abnormal returns between $A F5$ and $A F1$ is 4.8 percent, while the spread between

Panel A shows cumulative abnormal return during $[-1,+1]$ window around earnings announcements for seasonal randomwalk earnings surprise quintiles (RW1-5) and for analyst-based earnings surprise quintiles $(A F1{-}5)$ . Abnormal return during the earnings-announcement period is defined as the firm return in excess of the corresponding Fama-French size and book-to-market six-porfolio benchmark return. Seasonal random-walk earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter t minus I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ , deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter t. Analystbased earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus most recent forecast for quarter $t$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t$ Panel B shows average excess net-buy for small trades during $[-1,\ +1]$ window around earnings announcements for seasonal random-walk earnings surprise quintiles (RW1-5) and for analyst-based earnings surprise quintiles (AF1-5). Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $^\mathrm{\Phi5,000}$ Panel C shows average excess net-buy for large trades during $[-1,\ +1]$ window around earnings announcements for seasonal random-walk earnings surprise quintiles (RW1-5) and for analyst-based earnings surprise quintiles (AF1-5). Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $^{\S30,000}$  

RW5 and RW1 is 4.3 percent. The spreads are not statistically different $\mathrm{(p=0.60)}$ b,but they are comparable to those reported by Livnat and Mendenhall (2006), who find a spread of 4.9 percent between the top and the bottom AF deciles, and 3.8 percent between the top and the bottom RW earnings surprise deciles in their sample.

Analyst-based earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter t minus most recent forecast for quarter t, deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t$ Panel B shows average excess net-buy for small trades during $[+6,\,+65]$ window following earnings announcements for seasonal random-walk earnings surprise quintiles (RWl-5) and for analyst-based earnings surprise quintiles $(A F1{-}5)$ Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $^\mathrm{\Phi5,000}$ Panel C shows average excess net-buy for large trades during $[+6,\,+65]$ window following earnings announcements for seasonal random-walk earnings surprise quintiles (RWl-5) and for analyst-based earnings surprise quintiles (AF1-5). Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $^{\S30,000}$  

Panel B of Table 2 presents the mean value of average excess net-buy for small trades for the 60-day post-earnings-announcement period. Results suggest that, within each AF quintile, small trader excess net-buy generally increases in RW quintiles. Thus, consistent with H1, small traders continue to trade on information in RW earnings surprises in the post-announcement period. We also find that small traders? excess net-buys decline in AF quintiles in the second and third RW quintiles. Therefore, it appears that, while small traders continue to trade in the direction of RW earnings surprises, they also trade in the opposite direction of AF earnings surprises.  

Panel C of Table 2 focuses on the average excess net-buy for large traders during the 60-day post-earnings-announcement period. In the second, third, fourth and fifth quintiles of the RW earnings surprises, large traders’ excess net-buys generally increase in AF quintiles. Thus, consistent with H2, large traders continue to trade on information in AF earnings surprises in the post-announcement period. In the first, second, third, and fourth AF quintiles, large traders′ excess net-buys generally decrease in RW quintiles. Therefore, it appears that, while large traders continue to trade in the direction of AF earnings surprises, they also trade in the opposite direction of RW earnings surprises.  

# V. RESULTS OF HYPOTHESES TESTS Trading during the Earnings-Announcement Period  

We first examine trading during the earnings-announcement period. Specifically, to estimate Equation (5), we regress cumulative abnormal returns $(C A R)$ or average excess net-buy (EXBMS) for small or large traders during the three-day (i.e., $[-1,+1]$ earnings-announcement period on the decile ranks of the seasonal random-walk-based earnings surprises $(R W)$ and the decile ranks of the analyst-based earnings surprises $(A F)$ . Following Bernard and Thomas (1989), we scale $R W$ and $A F$ to be between O and 1 in all regression analyses:  

$$
C A R_{i}/D R I F T_{i^{\prime}}/E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i^{\prime}}/E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}R W_{i t}+\beta_{2}A F_{i t}+\varepsilon_{1i t}.
$$  

We report regression results estimating Equation (5) in Panel A of Table 3. All t-statistics in this table and subsequent tables are adjusted for clustering by firm (Rogers 1993). When the three-day $C A R$ is the dependent variable, the coefficients on the seasonal random-walk earnings surprise, $R W$ and the analyst-based earnings surprise, $A F.$ are  positive and significant $\langle\beta_{1}$ $=0.011$ ， $t\,=\,10.59$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.056$ $\mathrm{t}\,=\,46.46$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}]$ )." An F-test indicates that $\beta_{2}$ is significantly greater than $\beta_{1}$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ , suggesting that, while the market as a whole reacts to both the RW earnings surprises and the AF earnings surprises (Walther 1997), it reacts more intensely to AF earnings surprises.22

\* \*\* \*\* Represent significance levels at less than two-taled 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent, respectivly. All t-statistics in parentheses are adjusted for clustering by firm (Rogers 1993). Table 3 shows regression of cumulative abnormal return, average excess net-buy of small trades, and average excess net-buy of large trades during $[-1,\ +1]$ earnings announcement window and during $[+6,~+65]$ window following earnings announcements. Abnormal return during the post-earnings-announcement period is defined as the firm return in excess of the corresponding Fama-French size and book-to-market six-portfolio benchmark return. RW is the decile rank of seasonal random-walk earnings surprise converted to [O, 1], and $A F$ is the decile rank of analyst-based earnings surprise converted to [O, 1]. Seasonal random-walk earnings surprise is defined as IB/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ , deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter t. Analyst-based earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus most recent forecast for quarter $t$ defated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t$ . Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $\mathbb{S}5{,}000$ . Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $^{\S30,000}$  

When the small traders? excess net-buy (EXBMS_Small) is the dependent variable, the coefficients on $R W$ and $A F$ are positive and significant ( $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.055$ $t=13.84$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.016$ t $=3.81$ ， $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ ), but the coefficient on AF is much smaller $(\mathsf{p}<0.01)$ than that on RW. Thus, small traders react more to the RW earnings surprises than to the AF earnings surprises.  

When the large traders’ excess net-buy (EXBMS_Large) is the dependent variable, the coefficient on $R W$ is insignificant $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.005$ ， $t=0.55$ $\mathrm{p}=0.58,$ and the coefficient on $A F$ is positive and significant $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.106$ $\mathrm{t}=\,11.41$ ， $\mathrm{p<0.01})$ 0. Thus, large traders appear to respond only to analyst-based earnings surprises during the announcement period, consistent with Battalio and Mendenhall's (2005) result.  

# Testing H1 and H2: Trading during the Post-Earnings-Announcement Period  

Panel B of Table 3 provides the results of estimating Equation (5) for the 60-day (i.e., $[+6.$ $+65]$ period after the earnings announcements. When the cumulative abnormal return, DRIFT (i.e., the post-earnings-announcement drift), is the dependent variable, the coefficients on $R W$ and $A F$ are positive and significant ( $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.040$ ， $\mathrm{t}=6.73$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ .， $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.043$ ， $\mathrm{t}=7.47$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ consistent with the existence of distinct RW and AF drifts (Livnat and Mendenhall 2006). The coefficients for $R W$ and $A F$ are not statistically different $(\mathrm{p}\,=\,0.71)$  

Panel B of Table 3 also presents tests of H1 and H2. Consistent with H1, when we use the post-earnings-announcement small trader excess net-buy as the dependent variable, the coefficient on $R W$ is positive and significant ( $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.030$ $\mathrm{t}=15.21$ $\mathrm{p<0.01})$ 0. This evidence indicates that small traders continue to trade in the direction of RW earnings surprises after earnings announcements. Consistent with H2, when the post-earnings-announcement large trader excess net-buy is the dependent variable, the coefficient on $A F$ is positive and significant $(\beta_{2}\,{=}\,0.015,\,\mathrm{t}\,=4.30,\,\mathrm{p}<$ 0.01). This result indicates that large traders continue to trade in the direction of analyst-based earnings surprises after earnings announcements. In combination, this evidence is consistent with distinct sets of traders explaining, at least in part, the two post-earnings-announcement drifts.  

Results in Table 3, Panel B also indicate a negative and significant coefficient on $A F\left(-0.005\right.$ $t=-2.58$ $\mathrm{{p}=0.01}]$ ) in the small trader net-buy regression, suggesting that, while small traders continue to trade in the direction of the RW earnings surprises, they also trade in the opposite direction of the AF earnings surprises. Similarly, we find a negative and significant coefficient on $R W\left(-0.018,\mathrm{t}\,=\,-5.77,\,\mathrm{p}<0.01\right)$ in the large trader net-buy regression, suggesting that, while large traders continue to trade in the direction of the AF earnings surprises after the earnings announcements, they also trade in the opposite direction of the RW earnings surprises. These results are similar to the relations we find in univariate comparisons.  

A plausible explanation for large traders trading in the opposite direction of RW earnings surprises during the post-announcement period is that they provide liquidity to small traders trading on RW earnings surprises. Specifically, because large traders have an earnings expectation model different from that of small traders and consequently a different and independent estimate of the intrinsic value of the same firm, they may sell a security when the demand by small traders for the security pushes its price above large traders? private valuation of the security.  

Liquidity trading is less likely to explain the negative association between trades by less sophisticated small traders and AF earnings surprises and, thus, we investigate an alternative explanation: attention-based trading. Lee (1992), Battalio and Mendenhall (2005), and Hirshleifer et al. (2008) find that small traders are net buyers irrespective of the direction of the earnings surprise. Barber and Odean (2008) argue that retail investors are heavily infuenced by a “news attention'” effect that prompts buying whenever a company is in the news. To test the possibility that the negative coeficient on $A F$ may be due primarily to net-buying by small traders when $A F$ is negative, we add to Equation (5) an indicator variable, NegAF, which equals 1 if the analystbased earnings surprise is negative, and O otherwise. Consistent with individual net-buys following negative AF surprises explaining the negative association between small trades and AF surprises, the  coefficient on $N e g A F$ is positive and significant, while the coefficient on $A F$ becomes insignificant.?3 Further, following Barber and Odean (2008), we add trading volume, Vol, to Equation (5) to proxy for news attention and interact it with $N e g A F$ We define Vol as the average daily trading volume during the earnings-announcement period $[-1,\,+1]$ , scaled by the average daily trading volume during the control period $[-45,-6]$ . Consistent with attention-based trading, the coefficient on $N e g A F\times V o l$ is positive and significant while the coefficients on $N e g A F$ and $A F$ are insignificant.24  

# Testing H3 and H4: Effects of Announcement Period Trading Intensity on the Post-EarningsAnnouncementDrift  

H3 (H4) predicts that the intensity of earnings-announcement period trading by small (large) traders on RW (AF) earnings surprises reduces the magnitude of the post-earnings-announcement drift associated with RW (AF) earnings surprises. We run the following regression to test H3 and H4:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{D R I F T_{i t}=\theta_{0}+\theta_{1}R W_{i t}+\theta_{2}A F_{i t}+\theta_{3}E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i t}+\theta_{4}E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad\quad+\theta_{5}R W_{i t}\cdot E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i t}+\theta_{6}A F_{i t}\cdot E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i t}+\theta_{7}R W_{i t}\cdot E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad\quad+\theta_{8}A F_{i t}\cdot E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}+\theta_{9}R W_{i t}\cdot T r a n s C o s t_{i t}+\theta_{10}A F_{i t}\cdot T r a n s C o s t_{i t}}\\ &{\quad\quad\quad\quad+\theta_{11}T r a n s C o s t_{i t}+\varepsilon_{2i t},}\end{array}
$$  

where DRIFT is the 60-day $[+6,~+65]$ cumulative abnormal return. EXBMS_Small and $E X.$ BMS_Large are the three-day $[-1,\,+1]$ announcement period excess net-buy for small and large traders, respectively. TransCost is a measure of transaction cost that takes on values between O and $^{-1}$ and is defined as $^{-1}$ times the average of scores on the following three dimensions: (1) the decile ranking (scaled to between O and 1) of market value at the end of the earnings announcement quarter, (2) the decile ranking (scaled to between 0 and 1) of trading volume over the preceding fiscal year ending in the earnings announcement quarter, and (3) an indicator variable that equals 1 if price at the end of the earnings announcement quarter is greater than $\mathbb{S}10$ and o otherwise (Bhushan 1994; Kimbrough 2005).  

We test whether small (large) trades during the announcement period attenuate the relation between RW (AF) earnings surprises and post-announcement returns by interacting small (large) trades with RW (AF) earnings surprises in Equation (6). In this regression, the coefficient on the interaction term between small trades and RW earnings surprise (RW.EXBMS_Small) captures whether earnings announcement trading by small traders attenuates the association between RW earnings surprises and post-announcement returns (i.e., the Rw drift), as posited by H3. The coefficient on the main effect of announcement period small trades (EXBMS_Small) captures the overall relation between small trades and post-announcement returns, unconditioned on RW earnings surprises. We expect a negative coefficient on RW.EXBMS_Small.  

Likewise, the coefficient on the interaction term between large trades and AF earnings surprises (AF·EXBMS_Large) captures whether earnings announcement trading by large traders attenuates the association between the AF earnings surprises and post-announcement returns (i.e., the AF drift), as posited by H4. Similarly, the coefficient on the main effect of large trades (EXBMS_Large) captures the overall relation between announcement period large trades and postannouncement returns, unconditioned on AF earnings surprises. We expect a negative coefficient onAF·EXBMS_Large.  

Transaction costs reduce the incentives for arbitrage activities and, ceteris paribus, should enhance the post-earnings-announcement drift. Accordingly, we expect the coefficients on Rw.TransCostand $A F$ TransCost to be positive to the extent that transaction costs limit arbitrage opportunities associated with the Rw and AF drifts.  

Table 4 presents the results from estimating Equation (6). In Column (1), we report the results from estimating Equation (6) separately for small traders (i.e., excluding the EXBMS_Largeit  

TABLE4 Effects of Excess Net-Buy during Earnings Announcements Period on Post-Earnings-Announcement Drift   

![](images/04a96b88b255553ee49eac4a4fd68456b4420351377632d7bfe89f7de09a42c6.jpg)  

In Column (1), the coefficients on $R W$ and $A F$ are positive and significant, verifying that the drift is associated with both RW and AF earnings surprises. In addition, consistent with H3, the coefficient on RW.EXBMS_Small is negative and significant ( $\theta_{5}\!=\!-0.044$ $\mathrm{t}=-3.20$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ ) As predicted, this evidence suggests that small traders’ announcement period trading intensity, conditioned on RW earnings surprises, reduces the magnitude of the RW drift.?° In contrast, the coefficient on AF·EXBMS_Small is insignificant ( $\theta_{6}\,{=}\,0.009$ $\mathrm{t}\,=\,0.47$ $\mathrm{{p}=\mathrm{{0}}.64)}$ , indicating that small traders’ announcement period trading intensity does not reduce the AF drift.?' Finally, consistent with the drifts increasing with higher transaction costs, we find positive and significant coefficient on RW.TransCost (0.076, $\mathfrak{t}=2.67$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ ) and positive but insignificant coefficient on $A F.$ TransCost (0.042, $\mathrm{t}=1.49$ $\mathsf{p}=0.14;$ .28 Consistent with H4, Column (2) reports a negative and significant coefficient on AF·EXBMS_Large ( $\theta_{8}=-0.017$ $\mathrm{~t~}=\mathrm{~-}2.07$ $\mathrm{~p~}=\mathrm{~0.04})$ . Thus, as predicted, large traders’ announcement period trading intensity in the direction of AF earnings surprises reduces the AF drift. Interestingly, the coefficient on RW.EXBMS_Large is positive and marginally significant ( $\theta_{7}=0.015$ ， $t\,=\,1.72$ ， $\mathrm{~p~}=\,0.09_{,}$ 0, suggesting that when large traders trade more intensely during the earnings-announcement period in the direction of RW earnings surprises, the RW drift is enhanced."" As in Column (1), Column (2) also reports positive coeffcients on RW.TransCost (0.077, $t=2.71$ ， $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ )and $A F.$ TransCost (0.044, $t\,=\,1.54$ ， $\mathrm{~p~}=0.12,$  

When we run regression Equation (6) with small and large traders together, we obtain similar results. Specifically, in Column (3) the coeffcients on RW.EXBMS_Small and AF·EXBMS_Large are negative and significant ( $\theta_{5}\!=\!-0.046$ $\mathrm{~t~}=\,-3.29$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ $\theta_{8}=-0.018$ ， $t=-2.16$ ， $\textbf{p}=$ 0.03). In sum, this analysis suggests that the RW and AF drifts, at least in part, are attributable to the under-reaction (i.e., incomplete trading) by different groups of investors with alternative earnings expectations models.  

# VI. EVIDENCE OF ADDITIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RW ANDAFDRIFTS  

We conduct several analyses to further explore and contrast the RW and AF drifts. While our evidence suggests that the RW and AF drifts are attributable to distinct investor groups that under-react to RW and AF earnings surprises, we expect the nature of these two drifts to be qualitatively different because large traders are considered relatively more sophisticated than small traders (e.g., as evidenced by their more sophisticated earnings expectation model). In this section we provide additional analyses that investigate the persistence of trading associated with each drift, the predictability of post-announcement trades based on prior earnings surprises, the roles of analyst forecast heterogeneity and analyst forecast revisions after earnings announcements in explaining the drifts, and how the RW and AF drifts have changed in recent years.  

# Persistence of Trading after the Earnings Announcements  

While we find that small and large investors under-react to distinct forms of earnings surprises, we further investigate whether the persistence of investors’ post-announcement trading varies predictably with investor sophistication. To the extent that small traders are relatively less sophisticated than large traders as prior studies argue (Bhattacharya 2001; Bhattacharya et al. 2007; Malmendier and Shanthikumar 2007), we expect small traders’ trading on information in RW earnings surprises to continue longer during the post-earnings-announcement period and large traders’ trading on information in AF earnings surprises to concentrate at the early stage of the post-announcement period.  

To test our expectation, we divide the 60-day post-earnings-announcement period into three 20-day periods. We run the same regression Equation (5) for small and large traders during these three 20-day sub-periods. We expect that large traders’ activities are more concentrated in the first 20-day sub-period, while small traders’ activities are more evenly distributed among these three sub-periods.  

Consistent with expectations, results in Panel A of Table 5 show that small traders’ activities do not mainly concentrate in the early sub-period. In particular, the coefficient on $R W$ is positive and significant in all three 20-day periods ( $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.023$ ， $\mathrm{~t~}=\,9.59$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ for the first 20-day period, $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.033$ $t=12.80$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ for the second 20-day period, and $\beta_{1}\!=\!0.034$ ， $t=11.70$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ for the third 20-day period). In fact, it appears that small traders′ trading activities are persistent and even become more intensified over time. Indeed, using a stacked regression including each 20-day period, we find that the coefficients for the second and third 20-day periods are significantly larger than the coefficient for the first 20-day period $(\mathfrak{t}=4.36,\mathfrak{p}<0.01$ and $t=3.78$ $\mathrm{p}\,<\,0.01$ , respectively).3° Panel B reports results for large traders. The coefficients on $A F$ are positive and decline in magnitude ( $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.018$ $\mathrm{~t~}=\,3.27$ ， $\mathrm{~p~}<0.01$ for the first 20-day period, $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.014$ ， $ t=2.46$ $\mathrm{p}=0.01$ for the second 20-day period, and $\beta_{2}\!=\!0.010$ $\mathrm{t}=2.05$ ， $\mathrm{{p}=0.04}$ for the third 20-day period). Using a stacked regression including each 20-day period, we find that the coefficients for the second and third 20-day periods are significantly smaller than the coefficient for the first 20-day period $(\mathrm{t}\,=\,-1.67$ $\mathrm{~p~}=\,0.09$ and $t\,=\,-1.83$ $\mathrm{~p~}=\,0.07$ , respectively). Thus, consistent with our expectation, large traders’ trades are more concentrated during the early stage of the post-announcement period.31

RW is the decile rank of seasonal random-walk earnings surprise converted to [o, 1], and $A F$ is the decile rank of analyst-based earnings surprise converted to [O, 1]. Seasonal random walk-earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter t minus I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ , deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter t. Analyst-based earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus most recent forecast for quarter $t,$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t.$ Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $\mathbb{S}5{,}000$ . Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $\mathbb{S}30{,}000$  

# Trading around Earnings Announcements and Prior Earnings Surprises  

If small traders fixate on RW earnings surprises and are unaware of the serial correlations of RW earnings surprises, then we expect that small trades around earnings announcements are associated with lagged RW earnings surprises (Bernard and Thomas 1990). In contrast, if large traders are more sophisticated and their under-reaction is relatively short-lived, then their trades around earnings announcements are less likely to be associated with lagged AF earnings surprises. To examine the associations of trades at earnings announcements and lagged earnings surprises, we run the following regression:  

$$
E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i i}/E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}=\delta_{0}+\delta_{1}R W_{i t-q}+\delta_{2}A F_{i t-q}+\varepsilon_{4i t},\quad q=1,2,3,\mathrm{~or~}4,
$$  

where $q$ represents lagged one to four quarters.?-  

Table 6 reports the results from estimating Equation (7). We find that average excess net-buy for small traders around earnings announcements are positively associated with $R W_{t-1}$ $\left(0.043,\thinspace\mathfrak{t}=\right.$ 9.33, $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ $R W_{t-2}$ (0.027, $t=5.84$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}]$ $R W_{t-3}$ (0.024, $t=5.21$ $\mathrm{p<0.01}]$ ), and $R W_{t-4}$ (0.017 $,\,\mathrm{{t}}\,=\,3.78,\,\mathrm{{p}}\,<\,0.01)$ . These results suggest that small trades around one- to four-quarterahead earnings announcements are predictable based on prior RW earnings surprises. On the other hand, we find that excess net-buys for large traders are not associated with prior AF earnings surprises, indicating that large trades around future earnings announcements cannot be predicted based on prior AF earnings surprises. This evidence suggests that the RW drift (but not AF drift) is largely explained by small or unsophisticated traders′ failure to recognize the time-series properties of earnings, consistent with investor naiveté.  

# Heterogeneous Forecasts and Post-Announcement Trading  

To further differentiate the RW and AF drifts, we investigate whether the AF drift and postannouncement trades by large traders associated with the AF earnings surprise are more pronounced when the AF earnings surprise is more difficult to interpret (i.e., a longer price discovery process when earnings surprises are more difficult to interpret). Prior research finds that the AF drift is greater when analysts’ forecasts are more heterogeneous (Liang 2003), suggesting that investors have difficulty interpreting AF earnings surprises when analysts’ forecasts are less correlated. Based on Liang (2003), we estimate the following regression model to test the effects of forecast heterogeneity on drift and post-announcement trading:  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{C A R_{i^{\prime}}E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i^{\prime}}/E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i t}=\gamma_{0}+\gamma_{1}R W_{i t}+\gamma_{2}A F_{i t}+\gamma_{3}A F_{i t}\cdot H e t e r o_{i t}}}\\ {{+}}\\ {{+\ \gamma_{4}H e t e r o_{i t}+\varepsilon_{6i t}}}\end{array}
$$  

where Hetero equals 1 minus the BKLS analyst consensus (i.e., Barron et al. 1998). Specifically, wecomputeHeteroas:  

$$
1-{\frac{S E-D/N}{(S E-D/N)+D}}
$$  

where $D$ is the forecast dispersion, the sample variance of one-year-ahead annual earnings forecasts reported within 30 days following the earnings announcement; $N$ is the number of those forecasts; and $S E$ is the squared difference between the actual annual EPS and the mean of those forecasts. If there is only one forecast available, then we set Hetero to O (i.e., no heterogeneous information contained in analysts’ forecasts). Consistent with Liang (2003), we transform Hetero into deciles scaled between [O, 1]. We predict that the coefficient for $A F$ Hetero should be positive in both the $C A R$ and EXBMS_Large regressions if the AF drift and post-announcement trading on AF earnings surprises by large traders is more pronounced when analysts forecasts are more heterogeneous.

Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $55{,}000$ . Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $\mathbb{S}30{,}000$  

Results in Table 7 are consistent with our expectation. Specifically, we find that the coefficient On $A F$ Hetero is positive and significant in the large traders’ trading regression ( $\gamma_{3}=0.009$ ${\mathrm{~t~}}=$ 2.67, $\mathrm{p}\,=\,0.01$ ), indicating that large traders’ post-earnings-announcement period trading associated with AF earnings surprises is more pronounced when analysts? forecasts are more heterogeneous. Similar to Liang (2003), we also find a positive coefficient on $A F$ Heterointhe $C A R$ regression $(\gamma_{3}=0.056,\mathrm{t}=5.83,\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ 0. This evidence is consistent with investors and analysts requiring more post-announcement information or price discovery to interpret earnings surprises when analyst forecasts are more heterogeneous. Finally, consistent with the pattern in our previous analyses, the results for small traders are opposite to the results for large traders. Specifically, we find a negative and significant coefficient for $A F$ Hetero in the small trader regression $\lvert\gamma_{3}\rvert=$ $-0.030,\,\mathrm{t}\,=\,-8.02,\,\mathrm{p}<0.01)$

# Effect of Analyst Forecast Revisions during the Post-Announcement Period  

We next investigate how analyst forecast revisions in the post-earnings-announcement period affect large and small traders’ post-announcement trading on earnings surprises. We propose that large traders? under-reaction is corrected in the post-announcement period through a price discovery process and offer analyst forecast revisions as one source of information discovery (Gleason and Lee 2003). Specifically, we conjecture that post-announcement trades on AF earnings surprises may be at least partially explained by analyst forecast revisions in the post-announcement period that are correlated with AF earnings surprises. Because our previous results suggest that small traders are less likely to trade on AF earnings surprises, we expect that analyst forecast revisions are less likely to explain small traders’ post-announcement trades. We estimate the following regression to determine whether large and small trades on RW and AF earnings surprises in the post-announcement period are partially explained by post-announcement analyst forecastrevisions:  

$$
D R I F T_{i t}/E X B M S\_S m a l l_{i t}/E X B M S\_L a r g e_{i t}=\lambda_{0}+\lambda_{1}R W_{i t}+\lambda_{2}A F_{i t}+\lambda_{3}R e v_{i t}+\varepsilon_{\xi i t},
$$  

where $R e\nu$ is the decile rank of analyst forecast revisions during the post-earnings-announcement period. We compute an analyst's forecast revision as an analyst's most recent forecast issued during $[+46,+65]$ window minus the same analyst's earliest forecast issued during the $[+6,+25]$ window, scaled by lag stock price (Gleason and Lee 2003). To aggregate analyst-level revisions to firm-level, we average individual analysts? revisions for each announcement event. We code forecast revisions as 0 if the I/B/E/S Detail file reports no associated forecasts.  

We report regression results for Equation (10) in Panel A of Table 8.'? In the regression with post-announcement stock returns as the dependent variable, the coefficient on $R e\nu$ , is positive, 0.273, and significant $(\mathrm{~t~}=\,51.57$ $\mathrm{p}\,<\,0.01)$ . As expected, this evidence suggests that market returns incorporate information contained in analyst forecast revisions. Controlling for postannouncement revisions causes the coefficient on $R W$ to drop from 0.040 ( $\mathrm{~t~}=6.73$ ， $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ )to 0.013 $(\mathrm{t}=2.30$ $\mathrm{p}=0.02$ ; the coefficient decrease is significant at $\mathrm{p<0.01}$ ) and the coefficient on $A F$ to drop from 0.043 ( $\mathrm{~t~}=\,7.47$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01)$ to 0.020（ $\mathrm{~\AA~}[\mathrm{~\AA~}=\mathrm{~3.51~}$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ ; the coefficient decrease is significant at $\mathrm{{p<0.01}}$ . This evidence suggests that the information captured by analyst forecast revisions explains substantial portions of the RW and AF drifts.  

When we use excess buy-sell order imbalance of large traders as the dependent variable, the coefficient on $R e\nu$ is positive, 0.027, and significant $(\mathrm{t}\,=\,12.93,\,\mathrm{p}\,<\,0.01)$ , consistent with large traders incorporating the information contained in analyst forecast revisions in their trades. With the inclusion of revisions, the coefficient on $A F$ declines from 0.015 $\mathrm{~t~}=4.30$ ， $\mathrm{p<0.01})$ to 0.008 $\mathrm{~t~}=3.37$ ， $\mathrm{p}<0.01]$ ), a 46.67 percent decrease (significant at $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ ), whereas the coefficient on $R W$ remains largely unchanged. This evidence suggests that much of the post-announcement trading by large traders based on AF earnings surprises is attributable to information contained in

\*, \*\*, \*\*\* Represent significance levels at less than two-tailed 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent, respectively. All t-statistics in parentheses are adjusted for clustering by firm (Rogers 1993).  

Panel A of Table 8 shows regression of cumulative abnormal return, average excess net-buy of small trades, and average exces net-buy of large trades during $[+6,\,+65]$ window following earnings announcements. Abnormal return during the post-earnings-announcement period is defined as the firm return in excess of the corresponding Fama-French size and book-to-market six-portfolio benchmark return. Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $^\mathrm{\Phi5,000}$ . Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $\mathbb{S}30{,}000$ . RW is the decile rank of seasonal random-walk earnings surprise converted to [O, 1], and $A F$ is the decile rank of analyst-based earnings surprise converted to [0, 1]. Seasonal random-walk earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t,$ Analyst-based earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus most recent forecast for quarter $t$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t$ We compute an analyst's forecast revision as an analyst's most recent forecast issued during $[+46,\,+60]$ window minus the same analyst's earliest forecast issued during the $[+6,\,+25]$ window, scaled by lag stock price. To aggregate analyst-level revisions to firm-level, we average individual analysts' revisions for each announcement event. Rev is the decile rank (converted to [O, 1]) of this variable. Forecast revisions are coded as O if no associated forecasts are reported in the I/B/E/S Detail file.  

Panel B of Table 8 shows regression of excess net-buy of large trades during $[+6,\,+25]$ $[+26,\,+45]$ and $[+46,\,+65]$ subperiods. In Panel B, we compute an analyst's forecast revision as an analyst's most recent forecast issued during the respective 20-day subperiod minus the same analyst's previous most recent forecast, scaled by lag stock price. We then aggregate analyst-level revisions to firm-level by averaging individual analyst forecast revisions. $R e\nu$ is the decile rank (converted to [0, 1]) of this variable.  

analyst forecast revisions that continue to be correlated with AF earnings surprises well after the earnings announcements. This evidence is also consistent with the AF drift being largely attributable to a longer price discovery process by large traders, with analyst forecast revisions serving as one source of information discovery. In the small-trade regression, the coefficients on $R W$ and $A F$ are unchanged, while the coefficient on $R e\nu$ is negative and significant. This evidence suggests that post-announcement small trades associated with RW earnings surprises are not explained by information contained in analyst forecasts.'4  

Panel B of Table 8 presents results of large trades in the three 20-day subperiods. In this analysis, we compute an analyst's forecast revision as an analyst's most recent forecast issued during the respective 20-day subperiod minus the same analyst's previous most recent forecast, scaled by lag stock price. We then aggregate analyst-level revisions to firm-level by averaging individual analyst forecast revisions and calculate $R e\nu$ as the decile rank of the firm-level amounts. We find that the association between large trades and AF surprises becomes less significant during the $[+26,\,+45]$ period and completely disappears during the $[+46,\,+65]$ period after we control for Rev, whereas the association between large trades and $R e\nu$ remains significant across each subperiod. This evidence is consistent with price discovery through analyst forecast revisions explaining  the  association between  AF  surprises  and  large  trades  well after earnings announcements.35  

# Market and Trading Reactions to Earnings Surprises Over Time  

In recent years, analyst forecasts have become more readily available to all investors, which may result in small traders shifting away from RW earnings expectations (Brown and Caylor 2005). Likewise, in recent years, the analyst forecast drift appears to have received more attention, which could result in decreased AF drift as investors either arbitrage the drift or simply react more thoroughly to AF earnings surprises at earnings announcements. We explore these possibilities by introducing a time trend indicator into the following regression model:  

DRIFT;CAR:/ EXBMS_Small/ EXBMS_Largeit  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\lefteqn{\frac{\lambda}{(t)^{\tau_{i}}(t^{\mathrm{MC-1}L^{\tau_{i}}}\mathrm{i}t^{\prime}\mathrm{\Delta}\omega_{i})^{\tau_{i}}}\mathrm{-}^{\omega_{i}\tau_{i}\mathrm{att}\mathrm{\Delta}t}\mathrm{i}t^{\prime\mathrm{\Delta}\angle\mathrm{A}D^{\prime}\mathrm{i}\tau_{i}}\mathrm{-}^{\omega_{i}\tau_{i}}\mathrm{i}t}}\\ &{=\varphi_{0}+\varphi_{1}R W_{i t}+\varphi_{2}A F_{i t}+\varphi_{3}R W_{i t}\cdot R e c e n t_{i t}+\varphi_{4}A F_{i t}\cdot R e c e n t_{i t}+\varphi_{5}R e c e n t_{i t}+\varepsilon_{7i}}\end{array}
$$  

where Recent is an indicator variable that equals 1 if an earnings announcement occurs after 1999, and 0 otherwise.36  

Table 9 reports the results from this analysis. During the three-day earnings-announcement period, when we use abnormal return as the dependent variable, the coefficient on RW.Recent is insignificant, while the coefficient on AF·Recent is positive and significant $(0.009,\,\mathrm{t}=4.36,\,\mathrm{p}<$ 0.01), suggesting the market reacts more to AF earnings surprises in more recent years, consistent with Brown and Caylor (2005). When we use excess net-buy of small traders as the dependent variable, the coefficient on RW.Recent is negative and significant $(-0.066,\,\mathrm{t}\,=\,-8.01,\,\mathrm{p}<0.01)$

\* \*\*, \*\*\* Represent significance levels at less than two-tailed 10 percent, 5 percent, and 1 percent, respectively. All t-statistics in parentheses are adjusted for clustering by firm (Rogers 1993).   
Table 9 shows regression of cumulative abnormal return, average excess net-buy of small trades, and average excess net-buy of large trades during $[-1,\ +1]$ earnings announcement window and during $[+6,~+65]$ window following earnings announcements. Abnormal return during post-earnings-announcement period is defined as firm return in excess of corresponding Fama-French size and book-to-market six-portfolio benchmark return. RW is the decile rank of seasonal random-walk earnings surprise converted to [o, 1], and $A F$ is the decile rank of analyst-based earnings surprise converted to [O, 1]. Seasonal random-walk earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter t minus I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t{-}4$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter $t.$ Analyst-based earnings surprise is defined as I/B/E/S actual EPS for quarter $t$ minus most recent forecast for quarter $t$ deflated by price per share at the beginning of quarter t. Recent is an indicator variable that equals 1 if an earnings announcement occurs after 1999, and 0 otherwise. Small trade is defined as a trade at maximum $^\mathrm{\Phi5,000}$ . Large trade is defined as a trade at minimum $^{\S30,000}$  

while the coefficient on $A F$ Recent is positive and significant (0.027, ${\mathrm{t}}\,=\,3.06$ $\mathrm{p}<0.01$ ), suggesting that small traders decrease their reliance on RW earnings expectations and increase their use of analyst forecasts in more recent years (e.g., as analyst forecasts are more accessible). In comparing the sum of the coefficients for $R W$ and RW.Recent $(0.090\,+\,-0.066\,=\,0.024)$ to the sum of the coefficients for $A F$ and $A F$ Recent $(-0.000+0.027=0.027)$ , evidence suggest that in the later part of our sample period small traders trade approximately equally on RW and AF earnings surprises $\mathrm{\DeltaF=0.09}$ $\mathrm{~p~}{=}\;0.763)$ . In contrast, large traders continue to trade only on AF earnings surprises, although the association between large trades and the AF earning surprise declines in the later part of the sample period (i.e., the coefficient for $A F$ -Recent is negative and significant $(-0.067,\,\mathrm{t}\,=\,-3.63,\,\mathrm{p}\,<0.01)$  

During the post-earnings-announcement period, the magnitude of the AF drift decreases in more recent years (i.e., the coefficient for $A F$ Recent is negative and significant $(-0.073,\mathrm{~t~}=$ $-6.11$ $\mathrm{~p~}<\,0.01\$ )while the RW drift does not change (i.e., the coefficient for RW.Recent is insignificant). This evidence is consistent with a more efficient processing of information contained in the AF earnings surprises in more recent years as the AF drift has received more attention.37 Given the relatively new discovery and the little attention that the AF drift had received during the earlier years in our sample, we speculate that sophisticated investors may have not been exploiting the AF drift during this time period, which could explain the larger AF drift in earlier years.  

When we use excess net-buy of small traders as the dependent variable, we find that small traders² post-announcement trading intensity related to $R W$ decreases in more recent years (the coefficient for RW.Recent is $-0.053$ $\mathrm{\Delta};1=\mathrm{-}12.85,\mathrm{p}<0.01\mathrm{]}$ ), while that related to $A F$ increases in more recent years (coefficient for $A F$ Recent is 0.020, $\mathrm{~t~}=\,4.33$ $\mathrm{{p<0.01}}$ ). These results are consistent with the trading results around earnings announcements (i.e., decreased trading by small traders on RW earnings surprises).38 However, we continue to find a significant association between small trades and RW earnings surprises in the post-announcement period in the more recent time period (i.e., the sum of $R W$ and Rw.Recent is 0.0 $06,\,\mathrm{F}\,=\,11.66,\,\mathrm{p}<0.01)$  

When we use excess net-buy of large traders as the dependent variable, we find a decrease in trading on AF earnings surprises in the post-earnings-announcement period (i.e., AF·Recent is $-0.011,\,\mathrm{t}=-1.67,\,\mathrm{p}=0.09)$ . Nonetheless, we continue to find a significant association between large trades and AF earnings surprises in the post-announcement period in the more recent time period (i.e., the sum of $A F$ and $A F$ Recent is 0.o08, $\mathrm{F}=2.98$ $\mathsf{p}=0.09_{\cdot}$  

# VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION  

Recent research finds two distinct post-earnings-announcement drifts associated with RW and AF earnings surprises. We hypothesize that these two drifts are attributable to the trading activities of small and large traders who under-react to different forms of earnings innovations. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that small (large) traders continue to trade in the direction of RW (AF) earnings surprises after earnings announcements. We corroborate these findings with evidence that when small (large) traders react more thoroughly to RW- (AF-) based earnings surprises during the announcement period, the respective drift attenuates.  

In additional tests, we predict and find that the timing of post-announcement trading varies with trade size—i.e., large (and relatively more sophisticated) traders end their post-announcement trading more quickly than small (and relatively less sophisticated) traders, and that small trades (but not large trades) at earnings announcements are predictable based on prior earnings surprises. Further, we find that large traders’ post-announcement trading is more pronounced when AF earnings surprises are more difficult to interpret (i.e., when analysts’ forecasts are more heterogeneous) and that large traders′ post-announcement trades based on AF earnings surprises are largely explained by the information contained in post-announcement analyst forecast revisions that are generally in the same directions of the earnings surprises. Finally, we find that the AF drift and related large trades during the post-announcement period have decreased in more recent years as the AF drift may have received more attention.  

This study makes the following contributions. First, we predict and find that small traders systematically trade in the direction of RW earnings surprises after earnings announcements, whereas large traders? trading during post-earnings-announcement period is in the direction of AF earnings surprises. This evidence suggests that the RW and AF drifts are attributable, at least in part, to distinct sets of investors who use different earnings expectation models. Second, we provide evidence that trading activities during the earnings-announcement period affect the postearnings-announcement drift. To our knowledge, this is the first study to link either announcement period trading or post-announcement period trading by distinct groups of investors to the RW and AF drift. Third, we find that the two drifts are qualitatively different—delayed small trades associated with random-walk-based surprises are consistent with small traders’ failure to understand time-series properties of earnings, whereas delayed large trades associated with analyst-based surprises are more consistent with a longer price discovery process. Finally, we find that the AF drift and related large trades during the post-announcement period have decreased in more recent years as the AF drift appears to have received more attention.
